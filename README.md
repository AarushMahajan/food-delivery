DISTRIBUTE TRANSACTION (2PC)

This is replication of zomato/swiggy 10 min delivery system in Distributed Environment.


To achive 10 min delivery system we should have both food and the delivery partner.


So we have used 2PC (2 phase commit) Distributed Design Pattern to achive this. We have order service as our orchestration service.
